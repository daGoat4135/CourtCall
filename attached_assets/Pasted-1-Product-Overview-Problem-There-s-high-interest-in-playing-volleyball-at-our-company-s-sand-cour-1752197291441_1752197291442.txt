1. Product Overview

Problem:
There’s high interest in playing volleyball at our company’s sand court, but actual matches are irregular due to friction in organizing games. Current systems (Slack polls, spreadsheets) lack structure, visibility, and commitment—leading to missed opportunities for healthy play and team bonding.

Solution:
Create a lightweight internal web app or Slack-integrated tool (“CourtCall”) that makes scheduling and joining volleyball matches dead simple—with automated reminders, visibility into who’s playing, and a game count leaderboard to encourage participation.
